# project7: A Food Order App

I created this app in order to practice working with key front-end technologies and principles, namely React, React Router, Firebase, Axios, etc. 
During the process, I learned how to connect to a database, which I then proceeded to send and fetch data from. 
I also became more comfortable working with more complex and app-wide state, as well as handling user input. 

The application is a food ordering app where the user could add products to their order, alter their order, and finally checkout.
